# Matt Lloyd Writes Website

Matt Lloyd Writes is an author website for me to post pieces of my writing such as short stories, snippets from my books and poems, as well as an author profile and information about my upcoming books.

### Features to Add

## Content Management System

[Prismic](https://prismic.io/), a headless content management system, is used to create, manage and publish entries to the site. In Prismic I have defined a repeatable type which includes an ID number, title, content, date written, type dropdown and tags. I enter this information for each piece of writing in Prismic where it is saved and stored. Once published, this data is then converted into JSON to be accessible in my code, and then displayed as HTML on my webpages.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The live site can be found [here](https://matt-lloyd-writes.web.app/) or [here](https://matt-lloyd-writes.firebaseapp.com/).
